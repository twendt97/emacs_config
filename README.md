# Configuration directory for (x)Emacs

Place this directory in your home directory and under .emacs.d
For hints about the jjemacs package refer to [JÃ¶rg Arndt's ugly but usefull pages](https://jjj.de/)

## Language setup

For choosing the german ispell dictionary install this first with `sudo apt install aspell-de` and set the emacs ispell dictionary to german with `M-x ispell-set-dictionary`

## Irony setup
See the [Irony Git repo](https://github.com/Sarcasm/irony-mode). First install libclang with `sudo apt install libclang-dev` then run emacs as sudo enable irony-mode and run `irony-install-server`

Pretty usefull Videos can be found for [full setup on Mac](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjTCjqSZOAU&t=318s) and [irony configuration](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XeWZfruRu6k&t=705s)
